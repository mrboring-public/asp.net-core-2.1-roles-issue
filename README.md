# asp.net-core-2.1-roles-issue
This demonstrates the problem I am having with ASP.NET Core 2.1 role based authorisation.

The user admin@b.c has the Admin role (in the databse). When accessing the **About page**, I get the following:



> Access denied
>
> You do not have access to this resource.


## Admin user is:

|Name|Value|
|----|-----|
|Username|`admin@b.c`|
|Password|`P@ssword`|
